# Deep Learning for Natural Language and Code â€“ Exercises  

**Summer Semester 2025**  
**Prof. Dr. Steffen Herbold**

## Overview
This repository hosts the solutions for the exercises of the course **Deep Learning for Natural Language and Code**.  
The exercises focus on developing fundamental NLP and deep learning techniques from scratch, with minimal reliance on external libraries, in order to build a deep understanding of the underlying principles.

## Project Structure
- **/exercise_1/**: Text processing, Bag-of-Words representation, sentiment classification, and simple text generation using a Markov model.
- *(future exercises will be added here as new folders)*


## Goals
- Understand and manually implement fundamental NLP preprocessing techniques.
- Develop custom models for classification and text generation.
- Analyze, compare, and critically evaluate different text representations.
- Learn how standard tools and libraries operate internally by recreating their core logic.
